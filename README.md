# Project-partner-finder
The Project Partner / Group Finder system is a web-based application designed to assist stu- 
dents in finding suitable project partners and forming project groups based on common inter- 
ests, skills, and project preferences. The system aims to reduce the manual effort involved in 
group formation and improve collaboration efficiency. It provides features such as user pro- 
file creation, partner search, group creation, communication, and task coordination, thereby 
supporting students throughout the project lifecycle.
